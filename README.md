# Lesson Notes Secure and Private AI

This is my personal notes from the [course of udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/course/secure-and-private-ai--ud185) part of the [Facebook Scholarship Challenge](https://eu.udacity.com/facebook-AI-scholarship). These notes are forked from the original notes of the course but with some comments and notes added.

## How to use the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository

### Open In Google Colab

Every Notebook will have a badge at the top called *Open in Colab*. To run in Google Colab you can click on the button that will look like this:

### Run locally

To run these notebooks you'll need to install Python 3.6+, PySyft, Numpy, PyTorch 1.0, and Jupyter Notebooks. The easiest way for all of this is to create a conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n pysyft python=3
conda activate pysyft
conda install numpy jupyter notebook
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install syft
```

* **Day 1:** First template on [Study Tips](Study%20Tips.md) and general plan for the 60 days of code challenge.
* **Day 2:** Tomorrow...
