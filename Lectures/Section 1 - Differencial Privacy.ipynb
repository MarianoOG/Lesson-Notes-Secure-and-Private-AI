    "First of all, we talk about a **differencial atack** when an attaker is able to obtain information from a particular individual or group from a database by making a query to the entire database and to a sub-database derived from the original (with some data removed). Then, the attaker compares the difference between the outputs of this queries and with this results is able to obtain information about the individual or group. We say that a database is **differencially private** when this kind of attacks are not succesfull.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will first explore how a query can reveal information from an individual or group in the database. Then we will define differencial privacy with the help of the concept of sensitivity. And finally we will explore differencial privacy in the context of deep learning.\n",

    "**Key to the definition of differenital privacy is the ability to ask the question \"When querying a database, if I removed someone from the database, would the output of the query be any different?\"**. Thus, in order to check this, we will create sub-databases that we will call *parallel databases* which are databases with one entry removed."

    "\n",
    "This definition is a measure of how much privacy is afforded by a query M. Specifically, it's a comparison between running the query M on a database (x) and a parallel database (y). As a reminder, parallel databases are defined to be the same as a full database (x) with one entry/person removed.\n",

    "\n",
    "This theorem is called \"epsilon delta\" differential privacy. It says: for all parallel databases, the maximum distance between a query on database (x) and the same query on database (y) will be e^epsilon plus a probability delta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Epsilon\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epsilon Zero:** If a query satisfied this inequality with epsilon 0, then that would mean that the query for all parallel databases outputed the exact same value as the full database. If the sensitivity of a query is 0, then the epsilon value also happened to be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Epsilon One:** If a query satisfied this inequality with epsilon 1, then the maximum distance between the two random distributions M(x) and M(y) is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delta\n",
    "\n",
    "Delta is basically the probability that epsilon breaks. Sometimes the epsilon value is different for some queries than for others, delta represents this difference using probabilities. Note that this expression doesn't represent the full tradeoff between epsilon and delta.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson 5: How To Add Noise for Global Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we're going to learn about how to take a query and add varying amounts of noise so that it satisfies a certain degree of differential privacy (a certain epsilo-delta values). In particular, we're going to focus on global differential privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of noise we can add: **Gaussian Noise** or **Laplacian Noise**. Generally speaking Laplacian is better, but both are still valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How much noise should we add?\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of noise necessary to add to the output of a query is a function of four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the type of noise (Gaussian/Laplacian)\n",
    "- the sensitivity of the query/function\n",
    "- the desired epsilon (ε)\n",
    "- the desired delta (δ)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Querying Repeatedly:** If we query the database multiple times we can simply add the epsilons, even if we change the amount of noise and their epsilons are not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Laplacian Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "Laplacian noise is increased/decreased according to a _scale_ parameter b. We choose _b_ based on the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "b = sensitivity(query) / epsilon\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if we set b to be this value, then we know that we will have a privacy leakage of <= epsilon. \n",
