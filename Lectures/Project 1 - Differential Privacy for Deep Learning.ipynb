    "# Project 1: Differential Privacy for Deep Learning\n",

    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]( https://colab.research.google.com/github/MarianoOG/Lesson-Notes-Secure-and-Private-AI/blob/master/Lectures/Project%201%20-%20Differential%20Privacy%20for%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we defined perfect privacy as _a query to a database returns the same value even if we remove any person from the database_, and used this intuition in the description of epsilon/delta. In the context of deep learning we have a similar standard. **Training a model on a dataset should return the same model even if we remove any person from the dataset.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We've replaced \"querying a database\" with \"training a model on a dataset\". However, one should note that this adds two points of complexity which database queries did not have:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Do we always know where _people_ are referenced in the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to treat each training example as a single, separate person. Strictly speaking, this is not true as some training examples have no relevance to people and others may have multiple or partial relevance to people (consider an image with multiple or no people contained within it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Neural models rarely never train to the same output model\n",
    "\n",
    "Even on identical data the output model is different. Several proposals have been made to solve this problem. We're going to focus on one of the most popular, PATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Scenario: A Health Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a large collection of images from the patients of a hospital but you don't know what's in them. You realize that you can reach out to 10 partner hospitals which do have annotated data. It is your hope to train a classifier on their datasets so that you can automatically label your own. While these hospitals are interested in helping, they have privacy concerns regarding information about their patients. So you will use the following technique to train a classifier which protects the privacy of patients in the other hospitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You'll ask each of the 10 hospitals to train a model on their own datasets (all of which have the same kinds of labels).\n",
    "2. You'll then use each of the 10 partner models to predict on your local dataset, generating 10 labels for each of your datapoints.\n",
    "3. For each local data point (now with 10 labels), you will perform a _max_ function, where _max_ is the most frequent label across the 10 labels to obtain the final label. We will need to add Laplacian noise to make this Differentially Private to a certain epsilon/delta constraint.\n",
    "4. Finally, we will retrain a new model on our local dataset which now has labels. This will be our final _DP_ model."
