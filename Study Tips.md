# Study Tips For the course

Because of work I have been struggling to get time to work in this course. I got a few sleep and not as much progress as I would love to do. This is the list of thing I have done so far and that will probably help you as well to go through this course (or others).

## For deployments - stick with public frameworks!

This will make you avoid security issues and also help you stay in the state on the art and updated.

## Join the Differential Privacy Community

You can find them in http://slack.openmined.org/.

## Don't get ahead of yourself - DP is still in the early days

This means that new tecnologies are always raising and falling, there's no correct way to do things. Feel free to inovate and open to incorporate others techniques and drop down previous ideas.

## Speed up

Use speed 2x or 3x in the videos (or as fast as you can handle), most of them have really long explanations or even pauses so it will be fine. If you struggle to slow down if you are getting bored, then speed up. I recommend video control speed extension for chrome cause it lets you go beyond 2x that youtube offers natively.

## Skip not needed content

If you already have experience in some topic don't mind skipping parts or the whole video, there's no point in doing things double. If you have experience with machine learning probably Lesson 1 (intro to pytorch) it's a bit slow for you if you don't know about pytorch in specific but has used another framework watch some tutorials instead on how to use the basic functions and then discover the rest when you need them.

## Watch videos fast, program the exercises slowly

You may like to get your hands dirty, at least I like to do it. I learn more while trying to do stuff for myself so watch videos fast to get the idea but truly understand while doing the exercises, fork this notes or the original ones if you need. One of the things that were the most annoying for me is that the notes don't work as standalone information, I always needed to refer to the video for explanations and details which took longer in the switching. In the end, I either concentrate completely on watching or completely on doing. I will try to keep these notes self-explanatory to make the work faster even without videos. (work in progress).

## Use the comunity as a curated search engine

If you don't get it in the first google search, ask somebody else that may know it. This will substantialy reduce the time it takes you to understand some concept tough the eyes of someone that already processed and used it succesfully.

## Search for questions on the matter and answer them

This is a hard step, only use it when you have certain confidence on the topic and you already got some code working. Doing this will bring you new insights on problems you may not tought about and/or different solutions. It will also make you revisit concepts to properly explain to others not only how but why something works in a certain way.
