    "The database is going to be a very simple database with only one boolean column. Each row corresponds to a person. Each value corresponds to whether or not that person has a certain private attribute (such as whether they have a certain disease, or whether they are above/below a certain age). \n",

    "Key to the definition of differenital privacy is the ability to ask the question \"When querying a database, if I removed someone from the database, would the output of the query be any different?\". Thus, in order to check this, we must construct what we term \"parallel databases\" which are simply databases with one entry removed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Intuitively, we want to be able to query our database and evaluate whether or not the result of the query is leaking \"private\" information. As mentioned previously, this is about evaluating whether the output of a query changes when we remove someone from the database. Specifically, we want to evaluate the *maximum* amount the query changes when someone is removed (maximum over all possible people who could be removed). So, in order to evaluate how much privacy is leaked, we're going to iterate over each person in the database and measure the difference in the output of the query relative to when we query the entire database. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let's make our first \"database query\" a simple sum. Aka, we're going to count the number of 1s in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will measure the difference between each parallel db's query result and the query result for the entire database and then calculated the max value (which was 1). This value is called \"sensitivity\", and it corresponds to the function we chose for the query. Namely, the \"sum\" query will always have a sensitivity of exactly 1. However, we can also calculate sensitivity for other functions as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the intuition here. \"Sensitivity\" is measuring how sensitive the output of the query is to a person being removed from the database. For a simple sum, this is always 1, but for the mean, removing a person is going to change the result of the query by rougly 1 divided by the size of the database (which is much smaller). Thus, \"mean\" is a VASTLY less \"sensitive\" function (query) than SUM.\n",
